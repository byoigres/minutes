    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is <i>Sergio Flores</i>, I'm a web developer and I'm really bad managing my time.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day I was reading a <a href="https://medium.com/@chris_behnke/embrace-your-1440-e015f721a27a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a> on <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medium</a> that brought to my mind something I didn't realize: <strong>I have a plenty of time to invest in things that I really want, I just have to be patient</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Investing a little bit of time of the day in things you really want can brings you to amazing results in one week, one month or even a year. But like I said before, you have to be patient.
    </p>

    <p>
      After reading the <strong>Embrace Your 1440</strong> Medium's publication I started to wondering how many minutes did I have left of the day? Then I started writing the source code for a <i>simple webpage</i> that tell me that. The rest of the story is right here on your screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm really happy to launch this simple project because it's my first launch, all the other projects that I've been working on are unfinished and I hope this would change from now on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best of luck in every single goal you have. <strong>May the time be with you</strong>.

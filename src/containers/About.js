    <p>
      My name is <i>Sergio Flores</i> and I am really bad managing my time.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day I was reading a <a href="">publication</a> on <a href="https:">medium</a> that brought to my mind something I didn't realize, I have a plenty of time to invest in things that I really want, but I just have to be patient.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also realized that I waste a lot of time in meaningless things like checking my phone once in a while when trying to check for the time.
